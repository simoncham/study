## Questions

### 1.  Special Reverse

Write a function  to *"reverse"* a sentence (string) so that the sentence  "`Nice To Meet You`" will be converted to "`Ecin Ot Teem Uoy`". Let's assume it looks like in `C#`:

```cs
string SpecialReverse(string sentence)
```

The following are some test cases:

  |input|output|
  |--|--|
  |`Break a leg!`| `Kaerb a gel!`|
  |`No news is good news.`| `On swen si doog swen.`|
  |`Don't judge a book by its cover`|`Tno'd egduj a koob yb sti revoc`


### 2. Sorting Duplicates

Suppose we have a text file at the url [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simoncham/study/master/questions.txt), the columns are seperated by single spaces.  Write a console program to display the rows with duplicates data in  the first column or duplicates data in the third column.

  Example:  If the file content is:

  ```
  ASD4E944 1 99090921
  ASD4E945 2 99090922
  ASD4E946 3 99090923
  ASD4E944 4 99090922
  ASD4E947 5 99090925
  ```

  Then the output of your program should be:

  ```
  ASD4E944 1 99090921
  ASD4E945 2 99090922
  ASD4E944 4 99090922
  ```
   

### 3. BOM Explosion

** You may use `SQL` or `C#` to implement the algorithm.

We have a table to represent Bill of Materials, BOM (table name `boms` ) of a product. The following is the meaning of the fields of the table:

| column name | type | meaning |
|--|--|--|
| `parent_code`| varchar(20) | A parent item code in a BOM |
| `item_code` | varchar(20) | A child item code in a BOM |
| `usage` |  numeric(18,2) | The quantity indicates how many of the child item will be used in the parent item. The unit of this quantity is the UOM of the child item. |
    
    
We also have an Item Master table (`items`) with the columns:

| column name | type | meaning |
|--|--|--|
| `item_code` | varchar(20) | the code the item
| `uom`| varchar(10) | The base UOM of the item 
| `mat_cost` | numeric(18,2) | The material cost of the item in HKD.
    

Now we have the following data in the two tables:

`items`:

|item_code|uom|mat_cost|
|--|--|--|
|A|PCS| |
|B|PCS| |
|M|PCS| |
|X1|PCS|3.2|
|X2|M|6|


`boms`:

|parent_code|item_code|usage|
|--|--|--|
|M |X1| 1|
|M |X2| 2|
|B | M| 4|
|A | B| 2|
|A | M| 1|
|A |X2| 2|

Please write a program to calculate the total material cost of parent item "A".

For your reference, the material cost of item "B" is HKD 68.8.

### 4. Where-Used

** Using the database structure in question 3.  
** You may use `SQL` or `C#` to implement the algorithm.

Please write a **Where-Used** program to find the items that use an specific item. Let's assume it looks like in `C#`:

```cs
List<string> WhereUsed(string itemCode) 
```
Test cases reference:

```cs
WhereUsed("M")  //will give items "A" and "B".  
WhereUsed("X1") //will give items "A", "B", and "M".  
```
